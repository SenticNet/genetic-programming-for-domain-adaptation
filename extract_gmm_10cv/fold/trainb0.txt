 concept Alzheimers cured amp entering future society great - anywhere reason fall asleep trying figure on could even finish book
 book an audio file waited read surprised enthusiasm content author also snuck in odd biblically unsound thoughts eg gasped suggested Christ Hellwhat Bible passage evidences this

 appreciate story Daniel delayed angelbut am left wondering need deeper researching possible misintepretation too
 shame book turning such questionable venture me war author suggests must guard source material wellthe Bible well So farI join ditch valiant attempt energize Christians return Word itself
 wonder refund
 content book adequate layout leaves much desired find chapter table contents Pages labeled chapter information such chapter page belongs to content broken cases excercises divide paragraphs in half makes very confusing follow flow book reading jump case excercise knowing very confused authors publishers would rework flow book would rate much higher
 book very damaging approach idea absolute truth readers complained really Christian book focus isnt Christ its YOU
 Biblically centered dating would put focus loving people unconditionally Jesus would trying find perfect spouse premise book rather un-Christlike making enticing enough opposite gender would want marry you Its rather selfish really consider words John Baptist Christ must more must less well warning in Song Solomon Do awaken love so desires
 Shouldnt primary goal glorify Christ search earthly shortcuts fulfilling desires Finding spouse like science business clear procedures even guidelines Hearts broken therefore authentic Christlike love must precedence dont mean sound accusing book borders close type manipulation world cleverly calls seduction

 Remember Hollywood blacklist Hollywood Ten Ill bet know lot events even werent alive in 1950s Thats Tinseltown vested interest in keeping memory era alive era Red Scare Senator Joseph McCarthy waving infamous list communist subversives speech in West Virginia time congressional investigations time invoking Amendment might safe contempt charge would make look guilty sin in public eye select McCarthy era time great fear feared witch-hunt against communism Hollywood Why Because despite mountains claims contrary emerged years movie industry oozed communists so Reds in Hollywood should renamed town Little Moscow even today wont hear truth in media will however skinny really pick copy Ronald Radoshs Red Star Hollywood Film Colonys Long Romance Left
 Talk exploding myths Radoshs book co-wrote wife Allis cuts layers denial presents an ugly picture real Hollywood 1930s 1940s 1950s Vladimir Lenin little pipsqueak brought nightmare Marxism Soviet Union back in early part twentieth century soft spot film theater believed best spread communism globe movies plays exactly Kremlin crowd set accomplish in decades managed gain converts cause--men movers shakers like Budd Schulberg Joseph Losey Maurice Rapf--by allowing work closely Soviet film industry people back United States spread plague help party apparatchiks Willi Munzenberg VJ Jerome John Howard Lawson In time all writes Radosh branch communist party flourished in Hollywood So big names signed newcomers industry in an attempt make contacts find work communists fellow travelers themselves
 Hollywood branch communist party worked increase membership influence in ways most successful methods involved true United Frontism Popular Front techniques forming organizations surface embraced popular progressive lure in unsuspecting liberals maintaining strong communist control scenes Radosh reveals concerns people rise National Socialist Germany in 1930s helped increase membership although partys propensity change direction oftentimes overnight directives issued Kremlin tended alienate members Also putting heavy-handed discipline could fall an unsuspecting member time Albert Maltz example discovered inflexibility party wrote an article deemed revisionist upper hierarchy very public refutation article left little doubt strong-arm tactics scenes Despite ugliness Hollywood Reds occasionally displayed successful in spreading propaganda films like Mission Moscow The Spanish Earth The North Star Congressional investigations threw dupes in slammer silenced more repudiated warped views
 enjoyed Radoshs book Ive chance read author spouse obviously know theyre talking and Ronald Radosh communist years understands groups think act Red Star Hollywood occasionally suffers dry prose bewildering number groups individuals authors manage bring book back speed throwing in great anecdotes instance part learn Ronald Reagan at time liberal buddy William Holden crashing communist in an attempt inject common sense proceedings great fun read about Reagan started talking find verbal attack forty minutes God bless him account Albert Maltzs forced rehabilitation absolutely chilling sobering tale hints violent tendencies inherent in communism Arguably best part book however involves long strange trip writer Dalton Trumbo time blacklisting repudiation communist party in life So intriguing stories pop in book actual creation blacklist takes backseat
 recommendation warning readers attempt book In case former youre very familiar time period read background history Red Scare first so will assist in learning context help learn basics groups personalities blacklist In case latter topic so huge Radosh doesnt space cover important Reds Lillian Hellman Dashiell Hammett example individuals lot influence communism in film books Nevertheless book well worth time Read remember time Hollywood releases we innocent propaganda piece

 Its quite unfortunate Amazon reviewers so much trouble accepting very basic facts They like occupant White House rather motley crew surrounds seem live in separate reality need people give collective fairy tales country leaders forever good intentions

 reading reviews here note opinion divided its truly good Heinlein book not Most still consider pretty fair Heinlein yarn reviews read missed main points novel--which main reason its so interesting--whether its great Heinlein novel not
 commented themes book most will familiar Heinlein fans bigotry against main character an artificial genetically enhanced human most readers found reaction unlikely although theme pervades entire work reviewer asserts its even primary idea book
 important theme revolt against authority Heinlein readers will certainly know books such Moon Harsh Mistress Double Star Citizen Galaxy Stranger in Strange Land Sixth Column Revolt in 2100 others
 theme competent man also takes center stage in book famous familiar Heinlein theme although in book its competent genetically enhanced female
 However interpretations although true miss very important point In Heinleins novels world very unstable even dangerous place--but hope optimism conditions will better in future main characters in Heinleins books intimately involved in struggle overthrow oppressive governments--and succeeding creating better life themselves
 So matter precarious dark life in present might be Heinlein hope future confident humans would throw yoke oppression establish better society basically good would win evil in novel appears least partly perhaps substantially abandoned hope in favor much darker dismal depressing future humanity least earth Better prospects found off-planet newly colonized worlds
 evidence isnt hard find scattered book in narratives in conversations Friday boss Dr Baldwin way Kettle Belly Baldwin appeared knowledge in Heinlein book Gulf published in 1949 However characters new So charms book meet lot characters making book Heinleins output an memorable character brought back life in context
 back point Heinlein makes clear earth economically politically deteriorating most world completely Balkanized hundreds small petty states unpleasant idiosyncrasies Heinlein most small states faceless ciphers larger powerful states remaining
 US different divided smaller sovereign states Canada smaller states co-belligerants war other Its peace rarely lasts month In coup occurs in Chicago Imperium militant Republicans Democrats rounded executed--including children down age 14
 alarming idea large international corporations such IBM Shipstone Corp also participants instigators wars wipe entire cities such Acapulco corporations hard fight single geographical location in book internationals seem winning real geographically localized countries super corporations completely ruthless immoral killing hire mass murder common
 Heinlein holds little hope situation will improve--he sees elected officials venal corrupt parasites feeding public trough mouthing fatuous platitudes consumption an impotent perhaps naive public--a much darker cynical interpretation politics portrayed in Starship Troopers Moon Harsh Mistress Double Star in which remember correctly character remarks politics game mature man pleasure in
 Even con artists grifters Heinlein sees noble--at least theyre hardworking independents arent dole trying earn an honest living - Government personal corruption also ubiquitous police trusted in book disposing possible considered good idea--as long it course client powerful wealthy enough even physicians made arrange certain patient die operating table In fact in position authority--except Fridays boss Baldwin trustworthy
 In conversations boss Dr Baldwin tells Friday needs planet whats happening earth asks society truly sick--that normal conventions politeness manners deteriorated rudeness--which people sign strength In book good people seem run persecuted--while evil flourish unhindered An epidemic cholera bubonic plague could kill millions predicted possibly conspiracy Baldwin sees social good cities so overpopulated dysfunctional thinning population--however achieved--is worthwhile goal
 So overall darker pessimistic future Heinlein imagined time Heinleins strengths ability create believable alternate realities--which here--however dark depressing might be its greatest books not think counts an unusual worthwhile Heinlein book

 acutally read entire book unlike people gave book bad rating Ann Coulter Conservative genius pokes holes in liberal agenda like else intelligent makes very good arguements reason book 4 stars 5 chapter bit dull earlier writing therefore best should put chapter closer beginning so wouldnt thing reader remembers

 Mr Ruiz takes destructive constructive criticism arrogant place so above reproach would turn deaf ear forms criticism College writing professor gave opinion work authors line reasoning would believe professor trying poison mind feeding emotional garbage Mr Ruiz suggests 49 would rather believe instructor best interests heart seeking teach better writer

 an awesome book dont believe reviewers library read yourself definitely worth reading
 story Sheriff Bell an insufferable dullard wont shut criminals days really evil as opposed lovely knew growing up
 Hes also world-class boaster pages telling fantastic wife Loretta is Loretta spends most time baking writing evil criminals -- tells need know marriage
 yakkity-yakking doesnt stop there An even bigger gas-bag Chigurh motor-mouthed murderer In fact kills people twice shoots em bores em death weapon choice Lectures coins His final kill so long restrain flingling book train carriage
 technical front McCarthy structure drama in Classical way chose Boring way majority scenes end exactly expect character Moss believable goal McCarthy also omits obligatory final scene Chigurh prey Moss reason reading book doubt defy expectations reader Expectations might turn decent story in case
 Whats more Sheriff Bell scenes Chigurh Moss making narrator personal stake in action McCarthy writes good visual dialogue an inconsequntial narrator half story man run Moss exits story character invest in so plot grinds halt McCarthy resusitate connection whatever remaining main players
 So McCarthy put misery No Sheriff Bell waffles pages pages Vietnam unlike John Goodmans character Walter in Big Lebowski thats it
 verdict hope Loretta runs criminal Preferably evil
 The Fosters Market Cookbook Sara Foster Sarah Belk King bought in buy Food Network phase especially Sarah Foster demonstrate killer sticky bun recipe Food Networks In Marthas Kitchen show also in sticky bun-baking period gave too much work back straight breads
 main reasons book sat unopened shelves so long fact killer sticky bun recipe simply killer believe an easy sticky bun recipe means end result will fall expectations time sticky bun recipe funny baker Wayne Harley Brachman didnt snuff anyway Leave Julia Child me sticky bun recipe in Baking Julia LOT work in fact surpassed mall
 back Sarah Fosters book back harbored suspicion really good stuff in book disappointed
 Part attraction am sucker cookbook covers sandwiches think Fosters sandwich recipes interesting complete in Nancy Silvertons book devoted subject great resource happen source ideas sandwiches
 Otherwise book covers would expect especially strong topics would expect expertise such muffins biscuits scones soups salads egg dishes favorite criteria evaluating cookbooks recipe classic French omelet Foster like champ omelet tip follow eggs room temperature cracking beating them then quite impractical restaurant kitchen
 also quite good favorite criteria making stocks recipes very good non-foodies people care haute cuisine very long produce very acceptable chicken vegetable beef stock reservations suggestions lead waste perfectly good poached chicken hand include less edible vegetable cuttings stocks reason people hyperfussy stock making reasons
 fully endorse Ms Fosters recipes muffins biscuits scones good better recipes in books professional bakers books specializing in subjects
 hardest aspect worth buying book will complement current cookbook collection cookbook collector question moot will stop notable title hand The Joy Cooking would welcome supplement like fellow Martha Stewart alumnae Ina Gartens early cookbooks recipes commercial kitchen depends products good business products easy make
 also means selection recipes very good fare church bazaars bake sales Foster downsizing recipes household serving numbers am sure soups would work well times recipe size Just little careful multiplying spicier ingredients
 find recipes extremely well written full important details amateur chefs unlike books printed in good fashioned black white little highlight shading sidebars And dishes presented in living color photographs little real estate cutsie pics Fosters Market staff customers argument layout book chapter title pages names recipes written in kind multicolored hodgepodge similar maddening typography in Jamie Olivers excellent cookbooks
 Fostering kind material made Martha Stewart so respectable in shows genre cookbook very good sample would recommend looking recipes feel good market venue think example value money Ina Gartens cookbook

 Underworld an ambitious book examining politics economics popular culture in United States half twentieth century author Don DeLillo engages in interesting speculation hidden meanings connections lie beneath notice In world depicts people events seem connected kind field ether unnamable forces operate In opening scene lives hundreds thousands people joined an historic baseball game young man senses the body heat great city  small reveries desperations unseen haunts day In passages book connections form history system that thing feel in an office  sensing linked grids lap you
 book focuses Nick Shay man grit escapes meaningless life in Bronx an executive in waste disposal firm kind savant takes long time people produce transformation results in pretty long book 827 pages in hard cover edition DeLillo even interested in conspiracy theories secrets in Nicks personal transformation so shares lot arcane knowledge reader nuclear weapons industry environmental degradation J Edgar Hoover
 connections minor characters subplots rest book obvious would venture could omitted great harm Also DeLillos dialogue definite style characters seem hoard words an awful lot dont finish sentences defects depends readers tastes me much better book DeLillos White Noise Libra widely praised
 very romantic story graphic quite bit swearing in low-key way read read days later Too long read in sitting made cry
 very much looked forward ending book would happen so could move book found book pointless reading 482 pages cant even think adjectives describe Sally Clare Moody such poor job character development dont feel like know much women like main characters didnt feel though much real friendship all book too long plot unbelievable characters unlikable writing style annoying

 am fan Michael Crichtons that felt writing style particular book incredibly choppy certain characters well developed eg wife
 basic premise very interesting book suspenseful moved fast pace However Crichton added too characters made book too dense skim chapters wanted know happened end extremely bored
 Obviously long book -
 Sigrid
 interesting topics in book Arab-Israeli conflict much in book portion think Hubands treatment conflict so compromises entire work Huband begins section quoting an Arab although Israelis want peace really want it
 Well make this all know Israelis good bad want peace need peace spent past decades building nation want it reason need peace also reason easy tempt bogus offers peace just like tempting fish bait hook just fish need food Israelis need peace
 Huband didnt that
 know Israelis really want peace know Israelis innocent victims want peace know Israelis guilty thieves still want peace just illicit gains mean Huband imply Israelis really want or really appear want peace
 Well such claim surely falsehood that taunt all suppose bully decides beat up suppose bully claims want fight Obviously well prefer left beaten up bully taunt Its mere falsehood blatant bullies tease victims
 means Hubands book taunting Israelis Thats very good thing journalist do telling mere falsehoods
 Huband also implies Jews Arab land admit it an Arab country wonder one also wonder buying land high prices constitutes taking it all humans living planet existed in 1805 human alive in 1805 alive today stolen planet them not bought inherited it theft reason invalidate right humans live planet today
 Huband implies Arabs ought greater right steal Jewish land Jews land bought high prices Thats bad journalism too
 theres more author calls Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu an extremist Now might understand making snide remark Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir leader Stern Gang might even Prime Minister Menachim Begin leader Irgun Netanyahu again poor journalism way might want author calls Arabs extremists
 true antisemitic propaganda incitement in Arab world reminded Israelis similar propaganda incitement in Germany in 1930s resulted in analogies made Arab antisemitism today German antisemitism World War Two Huband makes fun such analogies think should seriously bad journalism
 author Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi seriously though Huband quotes explain Arabs innocent bystanders Jews visiting revenge Arabs European antisemitism total nonsense course bad journalism
 Now one-state solution Arab-Israeli conflict make sense Maybe so Israel exists in order protect Jewish rights provide refuge Jews exists provide state Jews will speak Hebrew natively attend Hebrew schools universities Hebrew traditions so forth in state large non-Jewish population Israel even ten thousand square miles would rather small state houses million Jews Jewish rights life liberty property immigration protected one-state solution best Besides people Arab state needed well real need mechanism attack destroy Israel
 author agrees one-state solution best think even acknowledges Israel part Middle East reason wanting one-state solution demolish Jewish rights rather support them rid human rights would bad in region

 Ruth Benedicts Chrysanthemum Sword an anthropological study Japanese culture World War II job spell Japanese like 3 great aspects book Benedicts main arguments hold true even day Although examples bit outdated modern perspective conclusions drawn examples still valid
 However due time written 1944-6 Benedict unable study in Japan Instead rely articles written Japan interviews Japanese immigrants In so Benedict able draw major conclusions Japanese Japanese society hierarchically structured in such class mobility debt amp#24681 on must repay world particularistic society easily adapt situation example Benedict tells hierarchy key aspects Japanese society so much so what called respect language 47 means forms speech altered reflect status speaker compared listener Meiji Restoration Emperor top hierarchy Shogun daimyo samurai farmers artisans merchants finally outcasts Japan operated in hierarchical order hundreds years worked very well result this Japanese people learned long order they could trust world 70 system guaranteed security so long rules 73 Although Meiji Reform attempted in part class distinctions terribly successful Samurai powerful bureaucrats merchants still wealthy farmers farmers outcasts still looked down - despite emancipation even todays Japan elite families such Mitsubishi Mitsui still very powerful Due integral role in Japans economy able sway Diet members opinions way
 unique aspect Japanese hierarchy Benedict tells us class mobility Just born merchants son mean commoner merchants pre-Meiji era wealthier able marry samurai families In way merchants descendants samurai samurai family marries money 72 Although still occurs today wealthy prestigious families also move gain social prestige studying hard best schools sure secure future graduates Tokyo University would very difficult find good job In manner even lowly farmers son an important man
 point should made clear Japanese hierarchy American view hierarchy quite correct Americans views very rigid controlling life - indeed is However authority father exerts family Shogun nation dictatorial opinions well-being entire group consideration decisions made The master house saddles great difficulty acts purely will 55
 Benedicts main observance Japanese sense amp#24681 indebtedness need repay it Japanese believe tells us child born immediately indebted Emperor will able repay even one-ten-thousandth back child also indebted parents does know indebted parents 102 Tied directly idea virtue In Japan repaying debts very important part life must careful remember amp#24681 Emperor parents Therefore considered virtue works repaying debts burden acquire more sense repaying continues even now evident in gift giving practices in an employee boss Years present paying back employment Also guest visits family will bring amp#12362amp#37202 sake small present repayment burdening family peculiar side-effect amp#24681 people help strangers in need so would give person amp#24681 would likely able repay
 Benedicts final insight Japanese culture ability adapt situation most obvious attitude Occupation Emperor announced unconditional surrender Japan Japanese considered natural events accepted such fact implied 305 numerous stories politeness showed American troops arrival in Japan Even fact resistance forces sabotage attempts Occupation strong testament ability Japans real strength Benedict says lies in ability say That failed completely path 304 Benedict Japan could make indispensable in commerce East could closer truth 314 Japans economy boomed Reconstruction made technological center world course could make such prediction fact Japan longer allowed an army money poured military could directed elsewhere
 Overall believe Chrysanthemum Sword accomplishes Benedicts goal describing fundamentals Japanese culture great addition existing literature Japan previously stated examples indeed old-fashioned ie stern mother-in-law tale Hachiko appear irrelevant study modern Japan however able draw examples still applicable should consider even though America today much America 40s sorts principles held today - also modern Japan

 unlikely novel will win Pulitzer Prize even nominated one huge encompassing theme substantial truths revealed scathing indictment society that is however tautly told bright compelling narrative characters would expect meet in real life
 is frankly type thing present-day aspiring authors should strive for average reader interested in dazzled an authors research bombarded symbolic references Freud interested in told good story an author well enough enough elements--the make novel great--will fall place Indeed so in Mr Perrottas most recent effort excellent Little Children Joe College works because very least fine art storytelling

 animal rights issue tricky one touches really deep questions means conscious rights experience suffering So might expect philosopher able sort ethical issues suggest forward so would disappointed book
 chapter lays philosophical foundation book Singer argues theres really basis assigning equal rights humans humans abilities Therefore equality must based recognition persons interests animals interests too deserve equal treatment Thats it Its terribly deep frankly even rational Singer doesnt bother elaborate
 So animals interests obviously an interest in suffering know animals capable suffering Singer signs seek avoid painful stimuli nervous systems bear superficial similarity humans doesnt criteria seem awfully generous me
 In fact based criteria would conclude monkeys capable understanding spoken language humans capable echolocation Monkeys in fact respond certain vocalizations relevant physiological structures understanding speech humans actually echolocate with lot practice point would seriously compare human echolocation bat echolocation ability monkeys process speech negligible relative humans Could also true capacity pain suffering dont think knows Singer doesnt shed light subject
 chapter animal testing lot chapter deals animals in scientific experiments weakest part book Singer finds most gruesome experiments in science history juxtaposes out-of-context quotes researchers make look like research useless mentions in passing vast majority animal experiments dont involve pain end chapter suggests medical experimentation should eventually stopped
 Part justification ending medical experiments notion such experiments dont actually contribute medical scientific progress idea unfortunately quite common people dont know medicine science However its completely incorrect most Singers arguments scientific value animal testing completely debunked example continues exploit thalidomide tragedy even though time book written incident unrelated animal testing
 In addition totally confused science Singer uncomfortable scientific method itself repeatedly suggests animal testing should in short term limited experiments will lead rapid advances in medical treatment like should look lost car keys left them Science doesnt work way point p 47 Singer complains series experiments shown first prove theory disprove theory finally support modified versions original theory sounds ridiculous philosopher its actually pretty good description scientific method
 chapter deals factory farming Singer firmer ground in previous chapter theres philosophy even rational discourse Its just page page description in case conditions animals large farm However in contrast chapter experimentation conditions describes standard practice majority farm animals would seem theres plenty room improvement comparatively minimal consequences humans although imagine situation worse publication edition book in 1990
 chapter deals vegetarianism calling boycott meat dairy products appeal basically emotional moved arguments preceding chapter will presumably find chapter convincing
 Curiously Singer doesnt call similar boycott medicine medical treatment even though argument would identical Even belief animal experimentation useless human medicine admit purchase such medicine directly pays animal research whos receiving treatment cardiac problems diabetes surgery takes prescription drugs contributing animal suffering Maybe Singer deals in book chapter vegetarianism its rather obvious omission
 chapter strangely place history human attitudes animals back thousand years might made sense put beginning book perhaps editor afraid losing readers
 chapter talks popular animal rights movements accomplishments Singer doesnt draw line violent organizations like Animal Liberation Front which FBI considers terrorist organization organizations actually help animals in peaceful like ASPCA speaks positively PETA in addition extremist activities supports violence arson dont know would this
 Ultimately bad book trivializes serious issue substituting emotional imagery rational argumentation fact humans benefit greatly actions adversely affect animals In realm science serious doubt length quality human life improved animal testing behaviors such meat-eating benefits subjective suffering greater assign weight costs benefits very difficult question Singer doesnt even attempt seriously
 In particular edition Communist Manifesto reader treated an introduction Leon Trotsky central leaders Russian Revolution well correspondence Marx Engels Manifesto bears repeated readings discussion

 cant speak authority deseg cases AM knowledgeable St Louis case spent years St Louis Board Education 1989 - 1993
 Simply put deseg destroyed St Louis Public Schools SLPSs arguably best large public school system in nation prior deseg segregated run white Lutherans
 Today 26 years deseg SLPSs year losing state accreditation state Missouri Lets consider facts rather disinformation dilettantes poseurs such Kozol
 COSTS
 Deseg cost State Missouri 8 Billion Kansas City St Louis cases bill in KC totaled 35 Billion finally ended St Louis case certainly passed 4 Billion mark These statistics scrupulously hidden leftist news media realized expenditure
 all state money diverted deseg cases stolen school district in Missouri participating in deseg case Small rural school districts routinely spend 4000 5500 pupil year In St Louis per-pupil expenditure high 11711 Yet rural so-called out-state districts better job educating graduating students despite half resources Im sure in Kozols mind merely goyim deserve better
 Ironically less affluent out-state districts robbed state funding deseg wealthier school districts in St Louis County experienced massive WINDFALL deseg reimbursed state AVERAGE per-pupil cost city transfer rather marginal cost wealthy districts such Clayton Ladue Parkway benefited massive infusion revenues although school districts traditionally out-spent Missouri district factor more For example Clayton spends 15000 pupil year
 ACHIEVEMENT
 In SLPSs half students test 20th percentile lower nationally standardized tests stat would even worse I am told LD or learning disabled kids standardized tests legions LD kids
 In rare moment wisdom sobriety federal judge sitting deseg case ordered test efficacy in early 1990s study called Lissitz Study revealed city students ie black students bused predominately white county school districts improved less academically category student in SLPS is improved less students in all-black naturally-integrated magnet schools
 Educational Testing Service still normed SATs 400 1600 average SLPS student combined SAT 760 Worse yet best most motivated students further educational aspirations self-selected SATs therefore highly skewed sample relative average SLPS student
 Deseg universally motivated laughable paradigm that throw enough money inner-city schools black kids will achieve level commensurate white kids even William Coleman repudiated research subject The Coleman Report cited in Brown v Board Kozol desegs defenders could spend time productively studying lessons The Bell Curve in order understand academic disparities races
 VESTED INTERESTS
 remarked defenders deseg will relent white kid driven system NAACP Legal Defense Fund co-plaintiff in most if ALL US deseg cases periodically distributed legal expenses federal courts very important source revenue NAACP experienced declining membership numerous financial scandals decades
 Similarly deseg meant great deal mindless expenditure billions bus students around most injurious elements St Louis deseg plan massive affirmative-action program administrators teachers SLPSs employ functionally illiterate individuals NBA less an employment agency lazy incompetent blacks political connections
 Essentially black women who 30 40 years ago employed in middle-class households domestic help SLPS teachers administrators I teacher really absorbed high school education could presumed able teach mystifies Kozol desegs defenders teachers administrators in SLPSs required SATs half would test significantly average know demonstrated fact
 Approximately half SLPS teachers 60 administrators attended Harris-Stowe State Teachers College lowest academic standards institution higher learning in Missouri time called admissions office told Harris-Stowe accepted applicants combined SAT 780 should surprise recent measures SLPS student SATs differ significantly teachers
 HYPOCRISY
 truly fascinating phenomenon observed seem defenders deseg kids actually participated in such program doesnt parent long understand deseg isnt so wonderful kid rolled lunch money day daughter beaten wont date race
 Kozol kids Ill just bet does participate in voluntary deseg programs resides The Jews mustard sort thing long merely allowed posture doesnt actually cost anything
 rare opportunity sit Dr Susan Uchitelle Jewish woman headed St Louis Desegs Voluntary Inter-district Coordinating Council 1980s 1990s She paid 60000 year could discern sole responsibility running interference news media so rubes wouldnt wrong idea joys benefits deseg stabbing gun-shot incident murder race riot
 considered an opportunity able question impertinence before Have children participated in voluntary transfer program That is kids would poster children county-to-city deseg program allowed transfer all-white county schools in order voluntarily bused inner-city schools
 think answer oh gentle reader response question far-reaching implications understanding world varieties inhabitants such Jonathan Kozol
 Ill give hint Susan Uchitelles attitude deseg very much like Leona Helmsleys attitude taxes
 like book organization abysmal decided sell back college bookstore future hapless students good reference guide
 like author gear book an audience terrified computers dealing gasp math
 religious friend thought might able find value in Christianity in Borgs new paradigm Borgs book amounts Borg admits Christianity historically factually true thinks truthiness Christianity to borrow Stephen Colberts term good enough treating Christianity concepts like born again metaphors escape problem defend actual truth Christianity Christian apologist store claims its worthwhile empty store will give warm feeling
 Christians dont really believe in Christianity want rationalize attend church might need hear dont think people dont point Christianity begin will convinced
 me should rational in deciding believe admit youre irrational in religious beliefs just gut anyway kind half-way house just doesnt

 book speculates advance computer technology in 21st century socio-political response it Although peppered interesting notions worth skimming much speculation unreasonable philosophically naive
 In chapter Kurzweil attempts lay sort theoretical framework speculations boils down belief Moores Law just instance cosmic principle exponential advance explains universe Big Bang evolution life Earth evolution technology chapter argues possible an intelligence create intelligent itself just evolution intelligently created us will soon create computers will build machines greater cognitive ability us indeed intriguing consider someday machines will outperform humans in ways book point best skimmed theres actually very little substance lot dry pseudo-intellectual filler
 Chapter 3 examines philosophical problem brought forefront super-advanced computers consciousness machines possess it Kurzweil unimpressively touches handful schools thought his sentences Descartes made wonder read subject besides pop philosophy though try decide them Instead prediction social eventually machines will accepted real people -- just real people will physically merge technology -- even sounds bizarre now theme again proves thought-provoking issues book
 Chapters 4 5 talk field artificial intelligence been needs go In section entitled The Formula Intelligence Kurzweil recipe strong AI future recursion neural nets genetic algorithms -- taking hints reverse engineering human brain wishful thinking Achilles heels book software entrepreneuer Kurzweil strangely blind evidence software hardly complex intelligent all exponentially Todays software systems perhaps bigger significantly smarter systems past decades software quality continues barely meet lowest expectations Despite Moores Law faith will continue provide cycles in hardware world progress in world software seems software engineer 15 years flat line an exponential curve Just compare hundreds man-years lastest version Windows versus would design implement Kurzweils ideal software able write powerful software
 Part problem Kurzweil simply ignores fields cognitive psychology epistemology in infancy seem even aware issues in fields would solved probably geniuses in order create strong AI Instead solutions predicts purely materialistic brain deciphering massively parallel hardware genetic algorithms
 Part 2 book focuses potential technologies most powerful computers speculates quantum computers doesnt waste time asserting someday will able download entirety brain quantum computer so computer will in effect clone persons mind Kurzweil in materialism seem even aware philosophical argument impossible also speculates nanotechnologies will eventually give unprecented ability manipulate physical reality
 Part 3 book comprised specific predictions 2009 2019 2029 2099 book written in 1999 2009 predictions just simple extensions things starting in 1999 wildly miss mark such as the majority reading displays the majority text created continuous speech recognition intelligent roads in use primarily long-distance travel Kurzweil could so in 10 year predictions bode well 20- 30- 100-year predictions Indeed predictions 2019 sound like science fiction novel sound plausible think must least 30 years speculations 2029 just fantastic In general predict based assumption technologies will deployed available underestimating myriad resisting factors legal political social market scientific etc
 Ultimately book fun skimming raises couple thought-provoking issues speculating technology 10 years in future necessarily foolish activity theres plenty foolishness found in
 sorry just thought book boring worst all good story alot food thought just written so poorly ruined
 mediocre intellectually lazy piece work will moderate value beginners basic points valuable exposed structure sorely lacks depth committment subject information value hold interest reader above average mental capacity

 Dr Steven Greer well-known figure fringe UFOlogy claims briefed senior government figures UFO issue minutes book reveals issue seriously
 Its an amateurish incoherent clip job unedited free-flowing interviews dozens scientists pilots governmentmilitary figures most experienced highly strange UFO episode though testimony second-hand

 consistent stylistic point Dr Greers initials appear -- accused missing self-promotion opportunities -- amateurish nature production net negative mark against him Its mess
 In foreword Greer material wasis so urgent deals future entire human race etc rushed publication would like think definitive word future entire human race will spelled right look like grown-ups

 Amy Goodman honest journalist in America maybe 20 - maybe YEAH  admire most Ms Goodman persistence - hard-working investigative journalists - Seymour Hersh Robert Fisk - - - punches in hours clock does evidenced in book summation highlights research leading build-up war in Iraq war stands now essential in rendering however reasons current policy made explicit - daily magnificent show Radio Free America - Pacifica Its nice collected in an easily referenced indexed hard copy
 Ive read Left series twice and times blazed Armageddon In honest opinion best in series Why Simply due logical progression
 main characters make stupid fatal mistake journey them heroes makea stupid move in judgment journey them longtime main characters in series decides step warzone in middle act God will save life
 Armageddon simply wildest books in series relies very little any deus machina bail stupid main characters
 True writing still simple characters even simpler point should alreayd know that thing Armageddon makes so good pace moves Its frenetic painstaking time possible constantly switching points view However an ordeal suffering especially haters LB stupidly stuck story so long life very very hopeful too ashamed admit they too love story
 Bottom line - things HAPPEN in book turd The Remnant virutally nothign note happened Armageddon puts pieces board final battle in Glorious Appearing
 should also mention title bit misleading book simply introduces Armageddon battle great war Glorious Appearing grand finale happens
 In case thumbs Armageddon

 found book embarrassing read - its risque so clearly illustrates French amp Italians reputations great lovers best English literature give us fellow clearly understands little female anatomy female sexuality
 Its also mean-spirited Lawrence proves points setting version idealized man even idealized woman spends most book trying knock down character concept real method proving superiority ideal drips too much contempt
 sex dumb meaningless ridiculous Attempting derive enjoyment mental life makes ridiculous paralyzed makes ridiculous trying sex in Lawrences true correct makes pathetic defective spiteful able enjoy sort lovemaking Lawrence proposes makes undeserving title woman man so on
 Looking Italian art stupid in Paris stupid Constance apparently glance in France sex properly
 Reading book openly contemptuous commentary whats wrong C M might easily conclude Constance doesnt really seem happier shes sleeping gamekeeper Hilda seem happier in Venice - author counters ridiculing that kind happiness delusional druglike even imply so pleased life proof theres wrong her Constance wretched thing that in Lawrences view really matters in life - Mellors Mellors equipment book degenerate phallus-worship makes authors hostility druglike pleasures seem sort ironically comical
 Hilda pathetic precisely derive enjoyment sensual pleasures Venice feel sun jazz dancing weird - Lawrence punishing uppity woman Hilda also worse pathetic - user strong suggestions cold immoral - enjoys part dancing press against strange man walk dance over This least reviewer called book sexist obviously Lawrence doesnt mind Mellors callous behaves user
 Its actually sort creepy an author claiming sensuality good consistently knocks sensual pleasures like feel sunshine ones body stupid sex - just sex notion real sex
 astute readers will most trouble Lawrence clearly defines real woman - Constance Chatterly - contrasting bad examples
 woman lays unfeeling clearly an example Such woman in terms suggesting lacks warmthdecencyheartwomanhoodetc Lawrence doesnt even seem considered possibility maybe man isnt could even related its presented quite clearly difference gooddesireable women vs women defective physically in character
 hand woman an unfeminine urge In Control - is insists moving herself rather sitting passive letting man will - forgivable Michaelis male because hes premature meant pathetic turns unforgiveable its women in general especially Mellors Bertha just refused should spite Bertha just sick  urge In Control demonstrating essentially vicious pathological nature thing Mellors wrong put in place promptly - spoilt her
 touchy-feely things women so frequently enjoy Forget it Lawrence suggests Mellors least kiss touch appears mostly incidental important Real Woman doesnt need foreplay Just hop go shes ought be shell feel crashing waves dark tides sooner later
 found most embarrassingly inaccurate - womans duty lie there too passive too active shes supposed and doesnt its fault mans job climb top perform based ought perfectly logical set assumptions are unfortunately true truth womans vagina equal-but-opposite inverse male penis theres thing males females start with in man penis in woman or remains clitoris Lawrence assume woman feels similar man feels - assigns feeling wrong body part
 Women bodies surely man so dedicated advancement sexuality could should time research women really feel things preferably women think men want hear This too doubt accused sexist author or least Mellors openly blames women will come crisis ought entirely womans man
 Its also likely science will eventually prove if hasnt already women like Constance Chatterly norm what woman ought be emotionally well physically Lawrence spends an awful lot energy ripping sees silly even noxious emotions desires - such intimacy connection Constance openly ridicule - biologists increasingly finding men women tend feelings expectations sex act believed an evolutionary advantage in differences based notion mans biological job DNA there reproduction woman involves heavy emotional physical commitment true would woman takes such cavalier reckless attitude sex deviant connect emotionally future sire child
 So - women feel Constance does time its so clearly obvious woman should feel way justify Lawrences open belittling women emotional states dont match masculine emotional detachment distance
 Theres lot talk tenderness - in fact Constance mentally accusing in Venice lacking tenderness - quite frankly am unclear exactly supposed so tender thing values quite clearly likes sex her even stands particularly good sex partner so difficult find
 imagine woman putting - imagine woman particularly treasuring - man rebuffs wishes talk rude treating equal remembering shes Lady asks questions calls c--t name generally treats whore could imagine woman finding fun game jumped of relationship really is spends too much time begging wanting beg reassurance - things wont questions wont answer - find undiluted enjoyment in relationship particularly credible
 its worth think life will better book obsolete exactly sort schlock women feeling pressured fake sexual responses - great cost marriages selves agree heppiness linked sexual satisfaction should in favor replacing book deals sex in reflects female sexuality in an honest realistic fashion just want good read - Id call matter personal taste Obviously people enjoy book Equally obviously not

 worldwide plague Robert Neville man left alive family dead surviving humans transformed vampires surround house very night in an attempt break in entice out attack him drink blood Holed in home converted safe house Robert struggles despair outsider status constant need seek shelter food protection desire discover possibly cure plague combination science fiction horror Am Legend an atmospheric stark survivalist text truly brilliant central concept scientific conception explanation vampire book short difficult put down well paced intelligent frightening huge literary impact authors in sci-fi horror genres highly recommend it consider most interesting books read
 read Am Legend time coming back read in high school now years ago story stayed very fresh in mind intervening years--or precisely science Mathesons conception vampires Coming back text very obvious aspects would stick so strongly most part narrative method conveying Mathesons sci-fi concepts--perhaps like true SF author puts scientific concept ahead character most important aspect characters personality emotions rather impact storys scientific concept them In case Am Legend concept scientific mostly logical explanation vampires its wonderful brilliant concept unique interesting enough remember in detail years still feel like final development sci-fi idea repercussions too quickly in limited detail making end book feel little too fast--nonetheless concept great one very interesting read about
 flips side situation however book lacks characterization emotion aspects arent entirely absent means Robert protagonist back story emotional phases greatly impacted apocalyptic survival setting finds in Hes realistically faulted in ways admirable Nonetheless personal characteristics even interactions past present exist primarily move towards expound on explain Mathesons scientific point conception vampires In cases obvious Richards memories serve build character also serve lead him thus reader better understanding vampires mere 160 pages Matheson could chosen give greater emphasis character--not so overwhelmed SF ideas so provided counterbalance emphasis plot idea found rest book lack realistic independently meaningful character makes sections book unmemorable makes book little bit too fast too simple result
 Despite thoughts critiques greatly enjoy novel highly recommend it Matheson achieves an incredible atmosphere in Am Legend constant paranoia terror grows stale overblown SF concepts detailed intelligent truly absorbing book combines horror sci-fi in else find greatly enjoyable read highly recommend text its good own--although short easily readable its wonderful back reread also makes great atmospheric intelligent horrorHalloween text
